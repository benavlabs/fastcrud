___
#### Detailed Changes

##### Endpoint Simplification and Deprecation of `_read_paginated`

###### Description

To streamline API endpoint configurations, endpoints with empty strings as names are now the standard. Additionally, the `_read_paginated` endpoint has been removed, with its functionality merged into `_read_items`.

###### Changes

- **Simplified Endpoint Configuration**: Endpoints can now be defined with empty strings to create cleaner paths.
- **Removed `_read_paginated` Endpoint**: Pagination is now handled via optional parameters in `_read_items`.

###### Usage Examples

**Paginated Read Example:**

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8000/items?page=2&itemsPerPage=10' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

**Non-Paginated Read Example:**

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8000/items?offset=0&limit=100' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'

```

##### Warnings

!!! WARNING
    The `_read_paginated` endpoint is deprecated. Use `_read_items` with pagination parameters instead.

!!! WARNING
    Default endpoint names are now empty strings. Adjust your configurations to match the new defaults.

___

##### `update_override` Argument in `upsert_multi` Method

###### Description

The `upsert_multi` method now includes an `update_override` argument, giving developers the ability to override the default update logic during upsert operations. This enhancement provides greater flexibility for custom update scenarios, such as utilizing SQL `CASE` statements or other complex expressions.

###### Changes

- **`update_override` Argument**: Allows custom update logic in `upsert_multi`.
- **Dialect Support**: Implemented for PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL.
- **Tests**: Added comprehensive tests to ensure functionality across different SQL dialects.

###### Usage Example

```python
from fastcrud import FastCRUD
from sqlalchemy import case
from .models.item import Item
from .database import session as db

crud_items = FastCRUD(Item)

await crud_items.upsert_multi(
    db=db,
    instances=[
        ItemCreateSchema(id=1, name="Item A", price=10),
        ItemCreateSchema(id=2, name="Item B", price=20),
    ],
    update_override={
        "price": case(
            (Item.price.is_(None), db.excluded.price),
            else_=Item.price,
        )
    }
)
```

___

##### Configurable `is_deleted` Field in Soft Delete Logic

###### Description

The `is_deleted` field in the soft delete logic is now optional and configurable. This change allows developers to customize the soft delete behavior per model, providing flexibility in how deletion states are handled.

___
#### Detailed Changes

##### Simplified Endpoint Configurations

In an effort to streamline FastCRUD‚Äôs API, we have reconfigured endpoint paths to avoid redundancy (great work by @JakNowy). This change allows developers to specify empty strings for endpoint names in the `crud_router` setup, which prevents the generation of unnecessary `//` in the paths. The following configurations illustrate how endpoints can now be defined more succinctly:

```python
endpoint_names = {
    "create": "",
    "read": "",
    "update": "",
    "delete": "",
    "db_delete": "",
    "read_multi": "",
    "read_paginated": "get_paginated",
}
```

Moreover, the `_read_paginated` logic has been integrated into the `_read_items` endpoint. This integration means that pagination can now be controlled via `page` and `items_per_page` query parameters, offering a unified method for both paginated and non-paginated reads:

- **Paginated read example**:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8000/users/get_multi?page=2&itemsPerPage=10' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

- **Non-paginated read example**:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8000/users/get_multi?offset=0&limit=100' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

###### Warnings

- **Deprecation Warning**: The `_read_paginated` endpoint is slated for deprecation. Developers should transition to using `_read_items` with the relevant pagination parameters.
- **Configuration Change Alert**: In a future major release, default endpoint names in `EndpointCreator` will be empty strings by default, as discussed in [Issue #67](https://github.com/igorbenav/fastcrud/issues/67).

###### Advanced Filters Documentation Update

Documentation for advanced filters has been expanded to include comprehensive examples of AND and OR clauses, enhancing the utility and accessibility of complex query constructions.

- **OR clause example**:

```python
# Fetch items priced under $5 or above $20
items = await item_crud.get_multi(
    db=db,
    price__or={'lt': 5, 'gt': 20},
)
```

- **AND clause example**:

```python
# Fetch items priced under $20 and over 2 years of warranty
items = await item_crud.get_multi(
    db=db,
    price__lt=20,
    warranty_years__gt=2,
)
```

___
##### Returning Clauses in Update Operations

###### Description
Users can now retrieve updated records immediately following an update operation. This feature streamlines the process, reducing the need for subsequent retrieval calls and increasing efficiency.

###### Changes
- **Return Columns**: Specify the columns to be returned after the update via the `return_columns` argument.
- **Schema Selection**: Optionally select a Pydantic schema to format the returned data using the `schema_to_select` argument.
- **Return as Model**: Decide if the returned data should be converted into a model using the `return_as_model` argument.
- **Single or None**: Utilize the `one_or_none` argument to ensure that either a single record is returned or none, in case the conditions do not match any records.

These additions are aligned with existing CRUD API functions, enhancing consistency across the library and making the new features intuitive for users.

###### Usage Example

###### Returning Updated Fields

```python
from fastcrud import FastCRUD
from .models.item import Item
from .database import session as db

crud_items = FastCRUD(Item)
updated_item = await crud_items.update(
    db=db,
    object={"price": 9.99},
    price__lt=10,
    return_columns=["price"]
)
# This returns the updated price of the item directly.
```

###### Returning Data as a Model

```python
from fastcrud import FastCRUD
from .models.item import Item
from .schemas.item import ItemSchema
from .database import session as db

crud_items = FastCRUD(Item)
updated_item_schema = await crud_items.update(
    db=db,
    object={"price": 9.99},
    price__lt=10,
    schema_to_select=ItemSchema,
    return_as_model=True
)
# This returns the updated item data formatted as an ItemSchema model.
```

___
##### Bulk Upsert Operations with `upsert_multi`

The `upsert_multi` method provides the ability to perform bulk upsert operations, which are optimized for different SQL dialects.

###### Changes
- **Dialect-Optimized SQL**: Uses the most efficient SQL commands based on the database's SQL dialect.
- **Support for Multiple Dialects**: Includes custom implementations for PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL, with appropriate handling for each's capabilities and limitations.

###### Usage Example

###### Upserting Multiple Records

```python
from fastcrud import FastCRUD
from .models.item import Item
from .schemas.item import ItemCreateSchema, ItemSchema
from .database import session as db

crud_items = FastCRUD(Item)
items = await crud_items.upsert_multi(
    db=db,
    instances=[
        ItemCreateSchema(price=9.99),
    ],
    schema_to_select=ItemSchema,
    return_as_model=True,
)
# This will return the upserted data in the form of ItemSchema.
```

###### Implementation Details

`upsert_multi` handles different database dialects:
- **PostgreSQL**: Uses `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`.
- **SQLite**: Utilizes `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`.
- **MySQL**: Implements `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`.

###### Notes
- MySQL and MariaDB do not support certain advanced features used in other dialects, such as returning values directly after an insert or update operation. This limitation is clearly documented to prevent misuse.

## [0.13.1] - Jun 22, 2024

#### Added
- More Advanced Filters by @JakNowy üéâ

#### Fixed
- Bug where objects with null primary key are returned with all fields set to None in nested joins #102

___
#### Detailed Changes

### Advanced Filters

FastCRUD supports advanced filtering options, allowing you to query records using operators such as greater than (`__gt`), less than (`__lt`), and their inclusive counterparts (`__gte`, `__lte`). These filters can be used in any method that retrieves or operates on records, including `get`, `get_multi`, `exists`, `count`, `update`, and `delete`.

#### Single parameter filters

Most filter operators require a single string or integer value.

```python
# Fetch items priced above $5
items = await item_crud.get_multi(
    db=db,
    price__gte=5,
)
```

Currently supported single parameter filters are:
- __gt - greater than
- __lt - less than
- __gte - greater than or equal to
- __lte - less than or equal to
- __ne - not equal
- __is - used to test True, False, and None identity
- __is_not - negation of "is"
- __like - SQL "like" search for specific text pattern
- __notlike - negation of "like"
- __ilike - case insensitive "like"
- __notilike - case insensitive "notlike"
- __startswith - text starts with given string
- __endswith - text ends with given string
- __contains - text contains given string
- __match - database-specific match expression

#### Complex parameter filters

Some operators require multiple values. They must be passed as a python tuple, list, or set.

```python
# Fetch items priced between $5 and $20
items = await item_crud.get_multi(
    db=db,
    price__between=(5, 20),
)
```
- __between - between 2 numeric values
- __in - included in
- __not_in - not included in

#### OR parameter filters

More complex OR filters are supported. They must be passed as a dictionary, where each key is a library-supported operator to be used in OR expression and values are what get's passed as the parameter.

```python
# Fetch items priced under $5 or above $20
items = await item_crud.get_multi(
    db=db,
    price__or={'lt': 5, 'gt': 20},
)
```

#### What's Changed
- Missing sqlalchemy operators by [@JakNowy](https://github.com/JakNowy) in https://github.com/igorbenav/fastcrud/pull/85
- Null primary key bug fixed in https://github.com/igorbenav/fastcrud/pull/107

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/igorbenav/fastcrud/compare/v0.13.0...v0.13.1

## [0.13.0] - May 28, 2024

#### Added
- Filters in Automatic Endpoints üéâ
- One-to-many support in joins
- Upsert method in FastCRUD class by @dubusster

___
#### Detailed Changes

##### Using Filters in FastCRUD

FastCRUD provides filtering capabilities, allowing you to filter query results based on various conditions. Filters can be applied to `read_multi` and `read_paginated` endpoints. This section explains how to configure and use filters in FastCRUD.


##### Defining Filters

Filters are either defined using the `FilterConfig` class or just passed as a dictionary. This class allows you to specify default filter values and validate filter types. Here's an example of how to define filters for a model:

```python
from fastcrud import FilterConfig

# Define filter configuration for a model
filter_config = FilterConfig(
    tier_id=None,  # Default filter value for tier_id
    name=None  # Default filter value for name
)
```

And the same thing using a `dict`:
```python
filter_config = {
    "tier_id": None,  # Default filter value for tier_id
    "name": None,  # Default filter value for name
}
```

By using `FilterConfig` you get better error messages.

###### Applying Filters to Endpoints

You can apply filters to your endpoints by passing the `filter_config` to the `crud_router` or `EndpointCreator`. Here's an example:

```python
from fastcrud import crud_router
from yourapp.models import YourModel
from yourapp.schemas import CreateYourModelSchema, UpdateYourModelSchema
from yourapp.database import async_session

# Apply filters using crud_router
app.include_router(
    crud_router(
        session=async_session,
        model=YourModel,
        create_schema=CreateYourModelSchema,
        update_schema=UpdateYourModelSchema,
        filter_config=filter_config,  # Apply the filter configuration
        path="/yourmodel",
        tags=["YourModel"]
    )
)
```

###### Using Filters in Requests

Once filters are configured, you can use them in your API requests. Filters are passed as query parameters. Here's an example of how to use filters in a request to a paginated endpoint:

```http
GET /yourmodel/get_paginated?page=1&itemsPerPage=3&tier_id=1&name=Alice
```

###### Custom Filter Validation

The `FilterConfig` class includes a validator to check filter types. If an invalid filter type is provided, a `ValueError` is raised. You can customize the validation logic by extending the `FilterConfig` class:

```python
from fastcrud import FilterConfig
from pydantic import ValidationError

class CustomFilterConfig(FilterConfig):
    @field_validator("filters")
    def check_filter_types(cls, filters: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        for key, value in filters.items():
            if not isinstance(value, (type(None), str, int, float, bool)):
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid default value for '{key}': {value}")
        return filters

try:
    # Example of invalid filter configuration
    invalid_filter_config = CustomFilterConfig(invalid_field=[])
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e)
```

###### Handling Invalid Filter Columns

FastCRUD ensures that filters are applied only to valid columns in your model. If an invalid filter column is specified, a `ValueError` is raised:

```python
try:
    # Example of invalid filter column
    invalid_filter_config = FilterConfig(non_existent_column=None)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Invalid filter column 'non_existent_column': not found in model
```

___
##### Handling One-to-One and One-to-Many Joins in FastCRUD

FastCRUD provides flexibility in handling one-to-one and one-to-many relationships through `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined` methods, along with the ability to specify how joined data should be structured using both the `relationship_type` (default `one-to-one`) and the `nest_joins` (default `False`) parameters.

###### One-to-One Relationships
- **`get_joined`**: Fetch a single record and its directly associated record (e.g., a user and their profile).
- **`get_multi_joined`** (with `nest_joins=False`): Retrieve multiple records, each linked to a single related record from another table (e.g., users and their profiles).


**Example**

Let's define two tables:

```python
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "user"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    tier_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("tier.id"))

class Tier(Base):
    __tablename__ = "tier"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String, unique=True)
```

Fetch a user and their tier:

```python
user_tier = await user_crud.get_joined(
    db=db,
    join_model=Tier,
    join_on=User.tier_id == Tier.id,
    join_type="left",
    join_prefix="tier_",
    id=1
)
```

The result will be:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example",
    "tier_id": 1,
    "tier_name": "Free"
}
```

**One-to-One Relationship with Nested Joins**

To get the joined data in a nested dictionary:

```python
user_tier = await user_crud.get_joined(
    db=db,
    join_model=Tier,
    join_on=User.tier_id == Tier.id,
    join_type="left",
    join_prefix="tier_",
    nest_joins=True,
    id=1
)
```

The result will be:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example",
    "tier": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Free"
    }
}
```


###### One-to-Many Relationships
- **`get_joined`** (with `nest_joins=True`): Retrieve a single record with all its related records nested within it (e.g., a user and all their blog posts).
- **`get_multi_joined`** (with `nest_joins=True`): Fetch multiple primary records, each with their related records nested (e.g., multiple users and all their blog posts).

!!! WARNING
    When using `nest_joins=True`, the performance will always be a bit worse than when using `nest_joins=False`. For cases where more performance is necessary, consider using `nest_joins=False` and remodeling your database.


**Example**

To demonstrate a one-to-many relationship, let's assume `User` and `Post` tables:

```python
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "user"
    id = Column(Integer, primary key=True)
    name = Column(String)

class Post(Base):
    __tablename__ = "post"
    id = Column(Integer, primary key=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("user.id"))
    content = Column(String)
```

Fetch a user and all their posts:

```python
user_posts = await user_crud.get_joined(
    db=db,
    join_model=Post,
    join_on=User.id == Post.user_id,
    join_type="left",
    join_prefix="post_",
    nest_joins=True,
    id=1
)
```

The result will be:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example User",
    "posts": [
        {
            "id": 101,
            "user_id": 1,
            "content": "First post content"
        },
        {
            "id": 102,
            "user_id": 1,
            "content": "Second post content"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/igorbenav/fastcrud/compare/v0.12.0...v0.12.1


## [0.12.0] - May 8, 2024

#### Added
- Unpaginated versions of multi-row get methods by @slaarti in #62  üéâ
- Nested Join bug fixes
- Dependency handling now working as docs say
- Option to Skip commit in some fastcrud methods
- Docstring example fixes
- `__in` and `__not_in` filters by @JakNowy üéâ
- Fastapi 0.111.0 support

___
#### Detailed Changes

##### Unpaginated versions of multi-row get methods
Now, if you pass `None` to `limit` in `get_multi` and `get_multi_joined`, you get the whole unpaginated set of data that matches the filters. Use this with caution.

```python
from fastcrud import FastCRUD
from .models.item import Item
from .database import session as db

crud_items = FastCRUD(Item)
items = await crud_items.get_multi(db=db, limit=None)
# this will return all items in the db
```

##### Dependency handling now working as docs say
Now, you may pass dependencies to `crud_router` or `EndpointCreator` as simple functions instead of needing to wrap them in `fastapi.Depends`.

```python
from .dependencies import get_superuser
app.include_router(
    crud_router(
        session=db,
        model=Item,
        create_schema=ItemCreate,
        update_schema=ItemUpdate,
        delete_schema=ItemDelete,
        create_deps=[get_superuser],
        update_deps=[get_superuser],
        delete_deps=[get_superuser],
        path="/item",
        tags=["item"],
    )
)
```

##### Option to Skip commit in some fastcrud methods
For `create`, `update`, `db_delete` and `delete` methods of `FastCRUD`, now you have the option of passing `commit=False` so you don't commit the operations immediately.

```python
from fastcrud import FastCRUD
from .models.item import Item
from .database import session as db

crud_items = FastCRUD(Item)

await crud_items.delete(
    db=db,
    commit=False,
    id=1
)
# this will not actually delete until you run a db.commit()
```

##### `__in` and `__not_in` filters
You may now pass `__in` and `__not_in` to methods that accept advanced queries:

- `__gt`: greater than,
- `__lt`: less than,
- `__gte`: greater than or equal to,
- `__lte`: less than or equal to,
- `__ne`: not equal,
- `__in`: included in [tuple, list or set],
- `__not_in`: not included in [tuple, list or set].

#### What's Changed
- Add unpaginated versions of multi-row get methods (w/tests) by [@slaarti](https://github.com/slaarti) üéâ
- Join fixes
- Dependencies
- Skip commit
- Docstring fix
- feat: filter __in by [@JakNowy](https://github.com/JakNowy) üéâ

#### New Contributors
* [@slaarti](https://github.com/slaarti) made their first contribution in https://github.com/igorbenav/fastcrud/pull/62 üéâ

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/igorbenav/fastcrud/compare/v0.11.1...v0.12.0


## [0.11.1] - Apr 22, 2024

#### Added
- `one_or_none` parameter to FastCRUD `get` method (default `False`)
- `nest_joins` parameter to FastCRUD `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined` (default `False`)

___
#### Detailed Changes

##### `get`
By default, the `get` method in `FastCRUD` returns the `first` object matching all the filters it finds.

If you want to ensure the `one_or_none` behavior, you may pass the parameter as `True`:

```python
crud.get(
    async_session,
    one_or_none=True,
    category_id=1
)
```

##### `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined`
By default, `FastCRUD` joins all the data and returns it in a single dictionary.
Let's define two tables:
```python
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "user"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    tier_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("tier.id"))


class Tier(Base):
    __tablename__ = "tier"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String, unique=True)
```

And join them with `FastCRUD`:

```python
user_tier = await user_crud.get_joined(
    db=db,
    model=Tier,
    join_on=User.tier_id == Tier.id,
    join_type="left",
    join_prefix="tier_",,
    id=1
)
```

We'll get:

```javascript
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example",
    "tier_id": 1,
    "tier_name": "Free",
}
```

Now, if you want the joined data in a nested dictionary instead, you may just pass `nest_joins=True`:

```python
user_tier = await user_crud.get_joined(
    db=db,
    model=Tier,
    join_on=User.tier_id == Tier.id,
    join_type="left",
    join_prefix="tier_",
    nest_joins=True,
    id=1,
)
```

And you will get:

```javascript
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example",
    "tier": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Free",
    },
}
```

This works for both `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined`.

!!! WARNING
    Note that the final `"_"` in the passed `"tier_"` is stripped.

#### What's Changed
- Reuse of `select` method in `FastCRUD`
- Skip count call when possible
- Add `one_or_none` parameter to FastCRUD `get` method
- Add `nest_joins` parameter to FastCRUD `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined`

#### New Contributors
- [@JakNowy](https://github.com/JakNowy) made their first contribution in PR #51.

___
#### Detailed Changes

##### Multiple Primary Keys Support
FastCRUD now accommodates models with multiple primary keys, facilitating more complex database designs. For models defined with more than one primary key, the endpoint creator automatically generates paths reflecting the primary keys' order. This feature extends support to primary keys named differently than `id`, enhancing the flexibility of FastCRUD's routing capabilities.

###### Example:
For a model with multiple primary keys, FastCRUD generates specific endpoints such as `/multi_pk/get/{id}/{uuid}`, accommodating the unique identification needs of complex data models.

##### Optional Count
The `get_multi` and `get_multi_joined` methods now feature an `return_total_count=False` parameter, allowing users to opt-out of receiving the total count in responses. This option can enhance performance by skipping potentially expensive count operations.

###### Behavior:
- By default, `return_total_count=True` is assumed, returning both data and a total count.
- When set to `False`, responses contain only the data array, omitting the total count for efficiency.

#### What's Changed
- Implementation of multiple primary keys support, addressing a significant flexibility requirement for advanced use cases.
- Introduction of optional count retrieval in multi-get methods, optimizing performance by eliminating unnecessary database queries.
- Several critical bug fixes, improving the stability and reliability of FastCRUD.
- Documentation enhancements, including the addition of a changelog section, ensuring users have access to detailed release information.
- Update to FastAPI `0.111.0`, ensuring compatibility with the latest enhancements in the FastAPI ecosystem.
- Achievement of 100% test coverage, marking a significant milestone in the project's commitment to reliability and quality assurance.

#### Relevant Contributors
- [@dubusster](https://github.com/dubusster) made a notable contribution with the implementation of multiple primary keys support in PR #31.

**Full Changelog**: [View the full changelog](https://github.com/igorbenav/fastcrud/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0)

## [0.10.0] - Mar 30, 2024

#### Added
- `select` statement functionality, thanks to @dubusster's contribution in PR #28 üöÄ.
- Support for joined models in the `count` method through the `joins_config` parameter.
- Filters for joined models via the `filters` parameter in `JoinConfig`.
- Type checking workflow integrated with `mypy` alongside fixes for typing issues.
- Linting workflow established with `ruff`.

___
#### Detailed Changes

##### Select
The `select` method constructs a SQL Alchemy `Select` statement, offering flexibility in column selection, filtering, and sorting. It is designed to chain additional SQLAlchemy methods for complex queries.

## [0.9.1] - Mar 19, 2024

#### Added
- Enhanced `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined` methods to support aliases, enabling multiple joins on the same model. This improvement addresses issue #27.

___
#### Detailed Changes

##### Alias Support for Complex Joins
With the introduction of alias support, `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined` methods now allow for more complex queries, particularly beneficial in scenarios requiring self-joins or multiple joins on the same table. Aliases help to avoid conflicts and ambiguity by providing unique identifiers for the same model in different join contexts. [Docs here](https://igorbenav.github.io/fastcrud/advanced/joins/#complex-joins-using-joinconfig).

###### Example: Multiple Joins with Aliases
To demonstrate the use of aliases, consider a task management system where tasks are associated with both an owner and an assigned user from the same `UserModel`. Aliases enable joining the `UserModel` twice under different contexts - as an owner and an assigned user. This example showcases how to set up aliases using the `aliased` function and incorporate them into your `JoinConfig` for clear and conflict-free query construction. [Docs here](https://igorbenav.github.io/fastcrud/advanced/crud/#example-joining-the-same-model-multiple-times).

#### What's Changed
- Introduction of aliases in joins, improving query flexibility and expressiveness, as detailed by @igorbenav in PR #29.

## [0.9.0] - Mar 14, 2024

#### Added
- Enhanced `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined` methods now support handling joins with multiple models.

___
#### Detailed Changes

##### Multi-Model Join Capabilities
The `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined` methods have been upgraded to accommodate joins involving multiple models. This functionality is facilitated through the `joins_config` parameter, allowing for the specification of multiple `JoinConfig` instances. Each instance represents a unique join configuration, broadening the scope for complex data relationship management within FastCRUD. [Docs here](https://igorbenav.github.io/fastcrud/advanced/joins/).

###### Example: Multi-Model Join
A practical example involves retrieving users alongside their corresponding tier and department details. By configuring `joins_config` with appropriate `JoinConfig` instances for the `Tier` and `Department` models, users can efficiently gather comprehensive data across related models, enhancing data retrieval operations' depth and flexibility.

!!! WARNING
    An error will occur if both single join parameters and `joins_config` are used simultaneously. It's crucial to ensure that your join configurations are correctly set to avoid conflicts.

#### What's Changed
- Introduction of multi-model join support in `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined`, enabling more complex and detailed data retrieval strategies.
- Several minor updates and fixes, including package import corrections and `pyproject.toml` updates, to improve the library's usability and stability.

## [0.8.0] - Mar 4, 2024

#### Added
- Feature to customize names of auto-generated endpoints using the `endpoint_names` parameter, applicable in both `crud_router` function and `EndpointCreator`.

___
#### Detailed Changes

##### Custom Endpoint Naming
The introduction of the `endpoint_names` parameter offers flexibility in defining endpoint names for CRUD operations. This enhancement caters to the need for more descriptive or project-specific naming conventions, enabling developers to align the API's interface with their domain language or organizational standards.

###### Example: Customizing Endpoint Names with `crud_router`
Customizing endpoint names is straightforward with the `crud_router` function. By providing a dictionary mapping CRUD operation names to desired endpoint names, developers can easily tailor their API's paths to fit their application's unique requirements.

###### Example: Customizing Endpoint Names with `EndpointCreator`
Similarly, when using the `EndpointCreator`, the `endpoint_names` parameter allows for the same level of customization, ensuring consistency across different parts of the application or service.

!!! TIP

    It's not necessary to specify all endpoint names; only those you wish to change need to be included in the `endpoint_names` dictionary. This flexibility ensures minimal configuration effort for maximum impact.

#### What's Changed
- Enhanced endpoint customization capabilities through `endpoint_names` parameter, supporting a more tailored and intuitive API design.
- Documentation updates to guide users through the process of customizing endpoint names.
